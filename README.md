# Emotion Recognition using CNN (MobileNetV2 & ResNet50V2)

In this project, we implement two CNN models for emotion recognition on the FER2023 dataset.

You can find the FER2013 dataset on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013).

For both CNN models, we apply data augmentation and resize the images to improve performance. After generating the models, we test them on real-life data, including images sourced from Google and a video showcasing various emotions.
